      <h1>Red</h1>
      <p>Red is a very hot color. It’s associated with fire, violence, and warfare. It’s also associated with love and passion. In history, it’s been associated with both the Devil and Cupid. Red can actually have a physical effect on people, raising blood pressure and respiration rates. It’s been shown to enhance human metabolism, too.</p>

      <h1>Orange</h1>
      <p>Another color belonging to the warm family, orange is often seen as a bright, optimistic and uplifting color. Both youthful and impulsive, orange often acts as a mental stimulant and is seen to be quite balancing. Orange is often seen associated with the third season in the yearly cycle: Autumn (or Fall). Due to the changing colors in the seasons, orange offers a warm transition from the brighter colors of summer before the harsher, cooler colors of Winter set in. Orange is also the main color associated with Halloween, which also takes places in the height of Autumn on October 31st.</p>

      <h1>Yellow</h1>
      <p>Known for its ability to promote clear thinking and quick decision making, yellow is probably most associated with happiness, positive energy and sunshine. Yellow, one of the three primary colors, is seen chiefly as a happiness-invoking, creative color and can therefore be used effectively to create designs that evoke feelings of happiness and clarity.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-12 text-center"> 
      <h1>Green</h1>
      <p>Belonging to the cooler family of colors, green is a rejuvenating color and is often described as a natural peacemaker, due to its many associations with relaxing aspects of nature. A combination of blue and yellow, green offers the mental clarity and enthusiasm of yellow mixed with the more emotionally calm and stable blue. In nature, we see green around us all the time - in leaves, grass, flowers and much more. Because of this, a lot of the associations we have with the color green are related quite heavily to nature and similar themes such as rebirth and fertility.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Associated Traits:</h3>
      <p>Spring, growth, renewal, rebirth, balance, nature, grass & gardens, stability, possessiveness, jealousy, envy, fertility, safety, money, and recycling.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-12 text-center"> 
      <h1>Blue</h1>
      <p>The coolest of all the main colors, blue is often seen as a very reliable and tranquil color, most likely due to the most obvious association of blue with the sea and the sky. A conservative color, it is often used well in designs that represent cleanliness and an air of responsibility.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Associated Traits:</h3>

      <h1>Purple</h1>
      <p>The last of the cooler color family, purple is seen as quite a mysterious color, usually representing ambition, royalty and power. A good combination of both red and blue, purple is intriguing and has both the calming, tranquil effect of blue and the energy that red offers. Purple is often seen as a color of luxury and works well in designs that need to show that bit more of an extravagant edge to it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Associated Traits:</h3>
      <p>Royalty, imagination, power, luxury, wealth, extravagance, ambition, wisdom, magic, and mystery.</p>
